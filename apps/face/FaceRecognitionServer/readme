* Prerequisites
Install Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x86)
http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=5555
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Directory structure
 - FaceRecognitionServer 
	- Release 
		- FaceRecognitionServer.exe (Server executable)
                - FaceRecognitionServer.ini (Server config) 
                - *.dll (DLLs required to run OpenCV) 
	- Cambridge_FaceDB - contains images that can be used for testing as well as training
	- DeteleFaceRecDatabase.bat - resets the image database 
        - lower3.txt - used for training and testing
        - upper6.txt - used for training and testing

 - FaceRecognitionClient (contains binaries for running an actual client. A webcam need to be connected for this client to work) 
	- Release 
		- FaceRecognitionClient.exe
                - FaceRecognitionClient.ini 
                IMPORTANT - copy all the ddls from FaceRecognitionServer/Release folder here. 
 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Training 

- $FACE_REC_SERVER = FaceRecognitionServer

- run $FACE_REC_SERVER/DeleteFaceRecDatabase.bat. 



- $FACE_REC_SERVER/FaceRecognitionServer.exe train <path to a text file> (e.g.,
..\lower3.txt) 
lower3.txt contains Person index, Person Name and path to an image file for that
person. The Person index should be unique and should match the person
name. The same format that is used both for training as well as testing. 

- The training is successfull if the program creates two bmp files
- There are batch files train*.bat inside the $FACE_REC_SERVER/Release folder can also be used to execute the above steps. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Testing in Bulk Mode
In this mode the testing is performed directly on the server without any network communication. If you want to communicate with the server you should use the FaceRecognitionClient

- $FACE_REC_SERVER/FaceREcognitionServer.exe test <path to a text file> (e.g., ..\upper6.txt) 
- There are batch files test*.bat inside the $FACE_REC_SERVER/Release folder can also be used to execute the above steps. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Testing with Windows Client 

- FaceRecognitionClient (contains binaries for running an actual client. A webcam need to be connected for this client to work) 
IMPORTANT - copy all the ddls from FaceRecognitionServer/Release folder to FaceRecognitionClient/Release folder. 
- Configure the IP and port in the configruation (FaceRecognitionClient.ini) file
